# External Memory Sorting

This is the code for External Memory Sorting in CS540 Assignment4.

The Emp.csv file we used for our tests is provided in the
zip package, but you can also test our code with the new file.

You can compile and run the code by following these steps:

1. Emp.csv file must be in the same directory as main4.cpp
2. Use the following commands to compile and run C++ code:

```c
g++ main4.cpp -o main4.out
main4.out
```

After performing the above steps, you should see a newly generated
EmpSorted.csv that store the results.
